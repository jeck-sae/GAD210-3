  text: The fourth sad circle.  Ah! what woes contain,   Justice of God! what woes
    those narrowing deeps   Contain; for all the universe down-heaps   In this pressed
    space its continent of pain,   So voiding all that mars its peace.  But why  
    This guilt that so degrades us?   As the  surge   Above Charybdis meets contending
    surge,   Breaks and is broken, and rages and recoils   For ever, so here the
    sinners.  More numerous   Than in the circles past are these.  They urge   Huge
    weights before them.  On, with straining breasts,   They roll them, howling in
    their ceaseless toils.
