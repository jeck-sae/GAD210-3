  text: When departs The fierce soul from the body, by itself Thence torn asunder,
    to the seventh gulf By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls, No place assign'd,
    but wheresoever chance Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt, It rises
    to a sapling, growing thence A savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves Then
    feeding, cause both pain and for the pain A vent to grief.  We, as the rest,
    shall come For our own spoils, yet not so that with them We may again be clad;
    for what a man Takes from himself it is not just he have. Here we perforce shall
    drag them; and throughout The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung, Each on
    the wild thorn of his wretched shade.
